    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <strong>About Me</strong> 
    <p>My name is Marlene Sahalon and I am currently a junior. My major is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_studies">Media Studies</a> because I enjoy designing websites, posts, ads, etc.
       I deffered school to become a licensed esthetician so I basically interact with clients everyday. My way of reaching them is through social 
       media platforms. <br>I try my best to think of how to get my name out there and also how to relate to the audience. I'm really excited to learn 
       more on developing a distinctive, relative, and creative way to share my knowledge through social media and web design.
